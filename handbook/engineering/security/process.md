## Process Overview

### Planning & Roadmap

ProductBoard serves as our tool for oversight and higher level planning. 

In it, you can find:
  * [Our roadmap](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/roadmap/2866503-fy2022-security) 
  * [A filtered view of all the things we (or others) would like us to do](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/feature-board/2130270-security)
    * These are a wishlist, refer to the status and whether they have a quarter set in order to judge whether we have them in our sights

Work stays in Product until it makes qualifies from "we might do this" to "we are going to". At that point, things transition over into Jira for more detailed planning and execution.

### Execution

Jira is intended only for **planned** work.
  * Big work 
    * Stuff we're **going to do** makes it into here via ProductBoard, where it gets broken down, ordered, and prioritized against other commited stuff
  * Small items that don't fit with the strategic roadmap, but that need to be done soon
  * Bugs
